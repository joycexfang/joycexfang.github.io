        <p>This is an acrylic painting that features two volunteers working to beautify their community. 
          A woman is holding an umbrella for a young girl who is painting a mural of a large yellow peace 
          sign with birds and hearts surrounding it. The idea for my painting was born after walking through 
          the streets of Camden with my family and looking at both graffiti on the walls and areas that are 
          being revitalized. After hours of brainstorming and sketching, I finally developed a piece that 
          showcases the importance of serving oneâ€™s community to create a better place for future generations. 
          U.S. Congressman Donald Norcross recognized me as a national winner in the 2018 Congressional Art 
          Competition, in which I represented the 1st District of New Jersey. The Congressional Institute 
          invited me to Washington D.C., where I was honored to have my painting displayed in the Canon Tunnel 
          of the U.S. Capitol for one year.
