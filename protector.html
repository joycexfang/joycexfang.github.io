        <p>A 12 by 16 inch acrylic painting that depicts a young girl who is comforted by a firefighter who has 
        just rescued her beloved dog from a devastating fire. I tried to capture the happiness that she feels 
        through her smile. With all of the chaos going on behind him, the firefighter takes the time to personally 
        deliver the puppy to the child. Overall, heroes like him deserve to be appreciated for their small but 
        powerful acts of compassion. I entered this piece in the Congressional Art Competition during my sophomore 
        year, but I did not receive any recognition. I spent the next few weeks revising the piece in order to 
        improve it. I decided to enter this revised piece to the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards and was named a 
        2018 South Jersey region winner.
